      I have a decade of experience in website development, with a focus on utilizing Angular. Prior to that, I had a significant amount of experience working with Wordpress. I had 5 years of experience working at Jack in the Box Corporate, where I successfully completed several large projects. Post Covid, I have been expanding my skill set by taking on contract frontend work, while also gaining expertise in various forms of woodworking, such as guitar-making at Taylor Guitars, and working with CNC machines and sheet metal.
